		<h3>Syd Barrett Biography</h3>
		<h5>Member 1964-1968</h5>
		<div class="imageHolderBio"> <img src="images/bandmembers/bame-syd-barrett.jpg" alt="Syd Barrett Portrait" /> <div class="caption"><br>Syd Barrett</div> </div><p><strong>Syd Barrett</strong> was born at 60 Glisson Road in the English city of Cambridge to a middle-class family. His father, Arthur Max Barrett, was a prominent pathologist, and both he and his wife, Winifred, encouraged the young Roger (as he was known then) in his music. When Barrett was three years old, his family moved to 183 Hills Road. After his brothers and sisters left home, his mother rented out rooms to lodgers, including a future Prime Minister of Japan. Barrett acquired the nickname <i>“Syd”</i> at the age of 14, a reference to an old local Cambridge drummer, Sid Barrett. Syd Barrett changed the spelling in order to differentiate himself from his namesake. His father died of cancer on December 11, 1961, less than a month before Barrett’s 16th birthday. He attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, now known as Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and enrolled in Camberwell art school in South London in 1964 before forming his first band in 1965. During this pre-Pink Floyd time he wrote such tunes as <i>Effervescing Elephant</i> to play at local parties.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Starting in 1964, the band that would become Pink Floyd underwent various line-up and name changes such as <i>The Abdabs</i>, <i>The Screaming Abdabs</i>, <i>Sigma 6</i> and <i>The Meggadeaths</i>. In 1965, Barrett joined them as <i>The Tea Set</i>, and when they found themselves playing a concert with a band of the same name, Barrett came up with the name “The Pink Floyd Sound” (later <i>The Pink Floyd</i>). He devised the name <i>Pink Floyd</i> by juxtaposing the first names of Pink Anderson and Floyd Council whom he had read about in a sleeve note by Paul Oliver for a 1962 <i>Blind Boy Fuller</i> LP (Philips BBL-7512): “Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, Pink Anderson or Floyd Council” these were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys”.</p>
		<br>
		<p>While Pink Floyd began by playing cover versions of American R&B songs (in much the same vein as contemporaries The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds and The Kinks), by 1966 they had carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll, which drew as much from improvised jazz as it did from British pop-rock, such as that championed by The Beatles. In that year, a new rock concert venue, the UFO, opened in London and quickly became a haven for British psychedelic music. Pink Floyd, the house band, was their most popular attraction, and, after making appearances at the rival Roundhouse, became the most popular musical group of the so-called “London Underground” psychedelic music scene.</p>
		<br>
		<p>By the end of 1966 Pink Floyd had gained a reliable management team in Andrew King and Peter Jenner. The duo soon befriended American expatriate Joe Boyd, who was making a name for himself as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. Boyd produced a recording session for the group in January 1967 at Sound Techniques in Chelsea, which resulted in a demo of the single <i>Arnold Layne</i>. King and Jenner took the song to the recording behemoth EMI, who were impressed enough to offer the band a contract, under which they would be allowed to record an album. The band accepted. By the time the album was released, <i>Arnold Layne</i> had reached number 20 on the British singles charts (despite a ban by the BBC) and a follow-up single, <i>See Emily Play</i> had done even better, peaking at number 6.</p>
		<br>
		<p>These first two singles, as well as a third (<i>Apples and Oranges</i>), were written by Syd Barrett, who also was the principal visionary/author of their critically acclaimed 1967 debut album, <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong>. The album’s title was taken from the mystical “Pan” chapter of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>. Of the 11 songs on <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong>, Barrett wrote eight and co-wrote another two.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong> was recorded intermittently between January and July 1967 in Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios. At that same time at Abbey Road the Beatles were recording Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in Studio 1 and the Pretty Things were recording S.F. Sorrow. When The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was released in August of that year, it became a smash hit in the UK, hitting #6 on the British album charts (the album was not nearly so successful in the USA). However, as the band began to attract a large fanbase, the pressures on Barrett contributed to his experiencing increasing psychiatric illness.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Barrett’s behaviour became increasingly unpredictable, partly as a consequence of frequent experimentation with psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Many report having seen him on stage with the group, strumming on one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore West in San Francisco, during a performance of <i>Interstellar Overdrive</i>, Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band’s consternation. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett apparently crushed Mandrax and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like <i>“a guttered candle”</i>. Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that <i>“Syd would never waste good mandies”</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Following a disastrous abridged tour of the United States, David Gilmour (a school friend of Barrett’s) was asked to join the band as a second guitarist to cover for Barrett as Barrett’s erratic behaviour prevented him from performing. For a handful of shows David played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally deigning to join in playing. The other band members soon tired of Barrett’s antics and, in January 1968, on the way to a show at Southampton University, the band elected not to pick Barrett up: One person in the car said, <i>“Shall we pick Syd up?”</i> and another person said, <i>“Let’s not bother”</i> (Gilmour interview in Guitar World – January 1995). They attempted to retain him in the group as a songwriter, much as The Beach Boys had with Brian Wilson, but this proved impossible.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are many stories about Barrett’s bizarre and intermittently psychotic behaviour, some are known to be true. According to Roger Waters, Barrett came into what was to be their last practice session with a new song he had dubbed <i>Have You Got It, Yet?</i>. The song seemed simple enough when he first presented it to his bandmates, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn: while they were practising it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement. He would then play it again, with the arbitrary changes, and sing <i>Have you got it yet?</i>. Eventually they realised they never would and that they were simply bearing the brunt of Barrett’s idiosyncratic sense of humour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Barrett did not contribute any material to the band after <strong>A Saucerful of Secrets</strong> was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong>, only one (<i>Jugband Blues</i>) made it to the band’s second album; one became a less-than-successful single (<i>Apples and Oranges</i>), and two others (<i>Scream Thy Last Scream</i> and <i>Vegetable Man</i>) were never officially released. Barrett supposedly spent some time outside the recording studio, waiting to be invited in (he also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour). Barrett played slide guitar on <i>Remember a Day</i> (which had been recorded during the <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong> sessions) and also played on <i>Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun</i>. His main contribution to the album, <strong>Jugband Blues</strong>, is often seen by Pink Floyd fans as Barrett’s admission that his days in the band were probably numbered (<i>“It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here/And I’m most obliged to you for making it clear/that I’m not here”</i>, the song opens). In March 1968 it was officially announced that he was no longer a member of Pink Floyd.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett distanced himself from the public eye. However, at the behest of EMI and Harvest Records, he did have a brief solo career, releasing two solo albums, <strong>The Madcap Laughs</strong> and <strong>Barrett</strong>. Much of the material on both albums dates from Barrett’s most productive period of songwriting, late 1966 to mid 1967, and it is believed that he wrote few new songs after he left Pink Floyd.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The first album, <strong>The Madcap Laughs</strong>, was recorded in two distinct sessions, both at Abbey Road Studios: a few tentative sessions took place between May and June 1968 (produced by Peter Jenner), while the bulk of the album was recorded between April and July 1969. The record was produced first by Malcolm Jones, a young EMI executive, and then by David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Jones states in his book <i>The Making of the Madcap Laughs</i> that <i>“when Dave came to me and said that Syd wanted him and Roger to do the remaining parts of the album, I acquiesced.”</i> A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band Soft Machine. Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers’ debut LP Joy of a Toy, although his performance on <i>Religious Experience</i> was not released until the album was reissued in 2003.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The second album, <strong>Barrett</strong>, was recorded more sporadically than the first, with sessions taking place between February and July 1970. This effort sounds more polished than the first, but Barrett was arguably in a worse state. The album was produced by David Gilmour and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Rick Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Despite the numerous recording dates for his two solo albums, Barrett undertook very little musical activity between 1968 and 1972 outside the studio. On 24 February 1970, he appeared on John Peel’s BBC radio programme <i>Top Gear</i> playing five songs – only one of which had been previously released. Three would be re-recorded for the Barrett album, while the song <i>Two of a Kind</i> was a one-off performance (the song appears on the 2001 compilation <strong>The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn’t You Miss Me?</strong>) with the lyrics and composition having since been credited to Richard Wright. Barrett was accompanied on this session by David Gilmour and Jerry Shirley who played bass and percussion, respectively.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one and only live concert during this period. The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall, London, and was part of a Music and Fashion Festival. The trio performed four songs, playing for less than half an hour, and because of poor mixing, the vocals were inaudible until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. All three came from the Barrett album, and were presumably aired to encourage people to buy the record. After this session, he would take a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about his American tour with Jimi Hendrix, and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1972, Barrett formed a short-lived band called Stars with ex-Pink Fairies member Twink on drums and Jack Monck on bass. Though the band was initially well received, one of their gigs at the Corn Exchange in Cambridge proved to be disastrous (Monck describes just how disastrous it was in a TV interview in 2001 for the BBC Omnibus series documentary <i>Crazy Diamond</i>). A few days after this final show, Twink recalled that Barrett stopped him on the street, showed him a scathing review of the gig they had played, and quit on the spot.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In August 1974, Peter Jenner convinced Barrett to return to Abbey Road Studios in hope of recording another album. However, little became of the sessions, which lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs (the only titled track is <i>If You Go, Don’t Be Slow</i>). Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label, moved into a London hotel and when the money ran out he walked back to Cambridge to live in his mother’s basement. Further attempts to bring him back (including one endeavour by The Damned who wanted him to produce their second album) were all fruitless. Until his death, Barrett still received royalties from his work with Pink Floyd from each compilation and some of the live albums and singles that had featured his songs; Gilmour has commented that he (Gilmour) “[made] sure the money [got] to him all right”.</p>
		<br>
		<p>According to a 2005 profile by a recent biographer Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother’s semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to his original art-form of painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also said to have been an avid gardener. His main point of contact with the outside world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. While reclusive, it was his physical health that prompted most concern, being afflicted with stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Although Barrett had not appeared or spoken in public since the mid-1970s, time did little to diminish interest in his life and work; reporters and fans still travelled to Cambridge to seek him out, despite his attempts to live a quiet life. Many photos of Barrett being annoyed by paparazzi when walking or biking, from the 1980s until his death in 2006, had been published in various media.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Apparently, Barrett was not happy being reminded about his past as a musician and the other members of Pink Floyd had no direct contact with him. However, he did go to his sister’s house in November 2001 to watch the BBC Omnibus documentary made about him and reportedly he found some of it “too noisy”, enjoyed seeing Mike Leonard (of Leonard’s Lodgers) again (who he called his ‘teacher’), and enjoyed hearing <i>See Emily Play</i> again.</p>
		<br>
		<p>His sister, Rosemary Breen, insists that Barrett neither suffered from mental illness nor received treatment for it at any time since they resumed regular contact in the 1980s. She allowed that he did spend some time in a private <i>“home for lost souls”</i> at Greenwoods in Essex but claimed there was no formal therapy programme there. Some years later, Barrett apparently agreed to sessions with a psychiatrist at Fulbourn psychiatric hospital in Cambridge, but Breen claimed that neither medication nor therapy was considered appropriate in her brother’s case.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Barrett died on Friday 7 July 2006 at his home in Cambridge. He died of pancreatic cancer, but this was usually reported as <i>“complications from diabetes.”</i> The occupation on his death certificate was given as “retired musician.”</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 2006, his home, located in St. Margaret’s Square, was placed on the market and reportedly attracted considerable interest. After over 100 viewings, many by fans, his house was sold to a French couple who bought the house simply because they liked it and reportedly they knew nothing about Barrett. His other possessions were auctioned for £120,000. NME produced a tribute issue to Barrett the week after with a photo of the songwriter on the cover.</p>
		<br>
		<p>According to a local Cambridge newspaper, Barrett left approximately £1.25 million to his two brothers and two sisters. This income was apparently largely acquired via royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings to feature songs he had written whilst with the band.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A tribute concert was held at the Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing (albeit not on stage at the same time for the last).</p>

		<h3>Roger Waters Biography</h3>
		<h5>Member 1964-1985</h5>
		<div class="imageHolderBio"> <img src="images/bandmembers/bame-roger-waters.jpg" alt="Roger Waters Portrait" /> <div class="caption"><br>Roger Waters</div> </div><p><strong>Roger Waters</strong> was born in Great Bookham, Surrey near Leatherhead, Waters grew up in Cambridge. Although his father Eric Fletcher Waters had been a communist and ardent pacifist, he fought in World War II and died in action at Anzio in 1944, when Waters was only five months old. Waters would refer or allude to the loss of his father throughout his work, from <i>Corporal Clegg</i> (<strong>A Saucerful Of Secrets</strong> 1968), through <i>Free Four</i> (<strong>Obscured By Clouds</strong> 1972) and the sombre <i>When the Tigers Broke Free</i>, first used in the movie version of <strong>The Wall</strong>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The album was recorded during the band's <strong>Division Bell Tour</strong> in 1994, specifically the UK and European leg, which ran from July to October 1994. The album includes a complete live version of The Dark Side of the Moon and features a booklet with many photos from performances on this tour. It also features <i>Astronomy Domine</i>, a Syd Barrett song not performed since the early 1970s.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Distrust of authority, particularly government, educational, religious and military institutions, is a recurring theme in Waters’ writing, and this is perhaps best evidenced in 1979′s <strong>The Wall</strong> and 1983′s <strong>The Final Cut</strong> (the latter album, pointedly, is dedicated to his father’s memory).</p>
		<br>
		<p>He and Syd Barrett attended the Morley Memorial Junior School on Hills Road, Cambridge, and later both attended the Cambridge County School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College), while fellow band member David Gilmour attended The Perse School on the same road. He met Nick Mason and Rick Wright while attending the Regent Street Polytechnic school of architecture. He was a keen sportsman and was fond of swimming in the River Cam at Grantchester Meadows. At 15 he was chair of YCND in Cambridge.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1965, Roger Waters co-founded Pink Floyd (after many different incarnations) along with Syd Barrett, Richard Wright and Nick Mason. Although Barrett initially did most of the songwriting for the band, Waters wrote the song <i>Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk</i> on their debut LP, <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong>. The album was a critical success and positioned the band for stardom. Barrett’s deteriorating mental health led to increasingly erratic behaviour, rendering him unable to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd’s lead singer and guitarist. Waters attempted to coerce his friend into psychiatric treatment; this proved unhelpful, and the band approached David Gilmour to replace Barrett at the end of 1967. Even the band’s former managers felt that Pink Floyd would not be able to sustain its initial success without the talented Barrett. Filling the void left by Barrett’s departure, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd’s new artistic direction. The lineup with Gilmour and Waters eventually brought Pink Floyd to prominence, producing a series of albums in the 1970s that remain among the most critically acclaimed and best-selling records of all time.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1970, Waters collaborated with British composer Ron Geesin (who co-wrote Pink Floyd’s title suite from <strong>Atom Heart Mother</strong>) on a soundtrack album, Music from “The Body”, which consisted mostly of instrumentals interspersed with songs composed by Waters. Within Pink Floyd, Waters became the main lyrical contributor, exerting progressively more creative control over the band: he produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for concept albums such as <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> and <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong>, for which he wrote all of the lyrics and some of the music. After this, Waters became the primary songwriter, composing <strong>Animals</strong> and <strong>The Wall</strong> largely by himself (though continuing to collaborate with Gilmour on a few tracks).</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters’ band-mates were happy to allow him to write the band’s lyrics and guide its conceptual direction while they shared the opportunity to contribute musical ideas (Gilmour described Waters as <i>“a very good motivator and obviously a great lyricist,”</i> even at the height of the acrimony between them in 1995). Some of the band’s most popular and beloved songs, including <i>Echoes</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Us and Them</i>, <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and <i>Shine On You Crazy Diamond</i>, feature the strong synergy of Waters’ sharp lyrical instincts combined with the melodic talent of Gilmour, the soft, precise drumming of Nick Mason, and atmospheric patterns of keyboardist Richard Wright (<i>Us and Them</i>, for instance, began as a sweetly melodic Wright keyboard instrumental and gained poignancy when Waters added plaintive antiwar lyrics). Unfortunately, this give-and-take relationship began to dissolve: a consequence of the band’s collective ennui, according to Waters. Song-writing credits were a source of contention in these difficult years; Gilmour has noted that his contributions to tracks like <i>Another Brick in the Wall, Part II</i>, with its blistering guitar solo, were not always noted in the album credits. Nick Mason addresses the band in-fighting in his memoir, <i>Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd</i>, characterizing Waters as being egomaniacal at times. It was while recording <strong>The Wall</strong> that Waters decided to fire Wright, after Wright’s personal problems began to affect the album production. Wright stayed with the band as a paid session musician while Waters led the band through a complete performance of his opus on every night of the brief tour that followed (for which Gilmour acted as musical director).</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1983, the last Waters/Gilmour/Mason collaboration, <strong>The Final Cut</strong>, was released. The sleeve notes describe it as being a piece <i>“by Roger Waters”</i> that was <i>“performed by Pink Floyd”</i> (rather than an actual Pink Floyd record). So, to many the album came across more like a Roger Waters solo album than Pink Floyd (similar to <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong> and, to a smaller extent, <strong>The Division Bell</strong> being tagged as Gilmour solo albums). Gilmour unsuccessfully tried to delay production on the album until he could author more material; Waters refused, and in 1985, he proclaimed that the band had dissolved due to irreconcilable differences. The ensuing battle between Waters and Gilmour over the latter’s intention to continue to use the name Pink Floyd descended into threatened lawsuits and public bickering in the press. Waters claimed that, as the original band consisted of himself, Syd Barrett, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, Gilmour could not reasonably use the name Pink Floyd now that it was without three of its founding members. Another of Waters’ arguments was that he had written almost all of the band’s lyrics and a great part of the music after Barrett’s departure. However, through agreement, Gilmour and Mason won the right to use the name and a majority of the band’s songs, though Waters did retain the rights to the albums <strong>The Wall</strong> (save for three of the songs that Gilmour co-wrote), <strong>Animals</strong>, and <strong>The Final Cut</strong>, as well as claiming ownership of the famous Pink Floyd pigs (although Gilmour circumvented the latter by equipping the 1987 version of the band’s pig with a splendid pair of testicles).</p>
		<br>
		<p>For many fans and casual listeners, the collaborative years of 1971-1979 remain the “classic” Pink Floyd years due to the albums released and prominence of Pink Floyd in music culture; a 1987 end-of-year review in Rolling Stone noted that Waters’ solo effort <strong>Radio K.A.O.S.</strong> and the post-Waters Pink Floyd album <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong>, if taken together, might have made a nice follow-up to <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>. In 2005, Waters agreed to rejoin Pink Floyd on stage for <i>Live 8</i>, and on 2 July 2005, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Rick Wright performed together on-stage for the first time since the June 1981 Wall concerts at Earl’s Court in London.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After his departure from Pink Floyd, Waters embarked on a solo career producing three concept albums and a movie soundtrack which did not garner impressive sales. His solo work has managed critical acclaim and even some comparison to previous work with Pink Floyd.</p>
		<br>
		<p>His first truly solo album, 1984′s <strong>The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</strong>, was a project about a man’s dreams across one night. The list of musicians helping Waters during recording included guitarist Eric Clapton and jazz saxophonist David Sanborn. Conceived around the same time as The Wall, the concept was shown and demos played to the Pink Floyd members, but they chose to proceed with <strong>The Wall</strong> over <strong>The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</strong>, rejecting the latter as <i>“too personal”</i> (Gilmour was later to claim that this was not as obvious a task as might first seem, as, in his opinion, both demos were <i>“unlistenable”</i> and <i>“sounded exactly alike.”</i> Longtime Pink Floyd engineer Nick Griffiths, however, says otherwise: <i>“They were seriously rough, but the songs were there.”</i> The album, not aided by Gerald Scarfe artwork that some claimed was sexist, received mixed reviews, with Kurt Loder describing <strong>The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking</strong> in Rolling Stone as a <i>“strangely static, faintly hideous record,”</i> adding that <i>“Waters sounds like the kind of guy who’d bring Hershey bars and nylons along on a first date.”</i> (Loder gave the album one star out of five, though user ratings have averaged four out of five). On the other end of the spectrum, Mike DeGagne of the All Music Guide praised the album for its <i>“ingenious symbolism and his brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm,”</i> rating it four out of five stars. The resulting concert tour featuring a set design by Marc Brickman and Mark Fisher of Park Display, and, on the first leg, Clapton on lead guitar, was not a success.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1986 Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the movie <i>When the Wind Blows</i>, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band, featuring Paul Carrack, was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. Waters’ then legal wranglings with Gilmour over the Pink Floyd brand are alluded to on the soundtrack album’s <i>Towers of Faith</i>, where the vocal transforms from <i>This land is my land</i>, to <i>This sand is my sand</i>, to <i>This band is my band</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1987 Waters (still accompanied by the Bleeding Heart Band, although not always credited as such) released another concept album, <strong>Radio K.A.O.S.</strong>, about a man named Billy who can hear radio waves in his head. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour, also in 1987. The sound system for the arena portion of the tour used numerous speakers which created a surround sound effect (Waters had already employed Holophonics (only the second act to do so, after Psychic TV) on <strong>The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</strong>, and <strong>Amused To Death</strong>; while <strong>Radio K.A.O.S.</strong> does not feature any system of spatial encoding, it was lauded for its production and stereo imaging, courtesy of long-time collaborator James Guthrie). Though applauded by many for its contemporary sound, the album did not garner the impressive sales he had achieved in Pink Floyd (years later, Waters himself would express dissatisfaction at the album, expressing distaste for the production, and particularly regretting his decision to trim the album from a double to a single, losing much of the concept in the process). This was possibly attributable to the fact that he was now competing with a reformed Pink Floyd who were touring to support their ‘comeback’ release, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (which Waters described as, <i>“A very facile but quite fair forgery”</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Waters staged a gigantic charity concert of <strong>The Wall</strong> in Berlin on July 21, 1990 to commemorate the end of the division between East and West Germany. The concert took place on Potsdamer Platz (a location which was part of the former “no-man’s land” of the Berlin Wall), and featured many guest superstars: The Band, Bryan Adams, Cyndi Lauper, Van Morrison, Sinead O’Connor, The Hooters, The Scorpions, Marianne Faithfull, and Joni Mitchell. It was one of the biggest concerts ever staged with an attendance of over 300,000 and was watched live by over five million people worldwide. However, the initial funds raised from the concert barely covered expenses, although syndication and home-video sales allowed Waters to present his chosen charity to benefit from the event, The Leonard Cheshire Foundation, with a sizeable donation.</p>
		<br>
		<p>1992′s <strong>Amused to Death</strong>, about the corrupting, desensitising nature of television, is perhaps Waters’ most critically acclaimed solo recording, with music critics comparing it to later Pink Floyd work, such as <strong>The Wall</strong> (Waters himself describes the record as the third in a thematically-linked trilogy, after <strong>Dark Side Of The Moon</strong> and <strong>The Wall</strong>). The album had one hit which was <i>What God Wants, Pt. 1</i> which hit #4 on Mainstream Rock charts. Jeff Beck, another legendary guitarist, saw action on Waters’s album as he played lead guitar. There was no tour in support of this record, although Waters would later perform several songs from this record nearly eight years later on his <i>In the Flesh</i> tours.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1999 Waters embarked on the <i>In the Flesh</i> tour which saw him performing some of his most famous work, both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a success in the US, and after Waters had booked mostly smaller venues (after the let-down in attendance from his 1987 tour), tickets sold so well that most of the concerts had to be upgraded to larger venues. With Gilmour’s Pink Floyd retiring after 1994, and many Floyd albums selling at the pace of Beatles records, Waters was in great demand. The tour eventually stretched across the world. Tickets were at such high demand, that the tour had to be spanned over three years. Almost every show was sold out with some venues garnering more sales than Pink Floyd shows of early touring years. One concert (Filmed in Portland, Oregon) was released on CD and DVD, named In the Flesh Live, after the tour. During this tour he played two new songs from his next solo album, <i>Flickering Flame</i> and <i>Each Small Candle</i>, as the final encore to the show.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters performed at a concert organised by the Countryside Alliance. In June of 2002 Waters played the Glastonbury Festival performing many classic Pink Floyd songs. This was the first time a special speaker system had been set up among the Glastonbury audience to enable sound effects to appear to be moving around amongst the crowd.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Miramax Films announced in mid-2004 that a production of <strong>The Wall</strong> was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent part in its production. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from <strong>The Wall</strong>, but also songs from <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>, <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong> and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On the night of 1 May 2004, the overture for <strong>Ća Ira</strong> was pre-premiered on occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta, performed over Grand Harbour in Valletta and illuminated by light artist Gert Hof. The event was broadcast over all EBU television stations.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In September 2004, Waters released two new tracks, <i>To Kill The Child</i> and <i>Leaving Beirut</i>.”These were released only on the Internet. Both of these tracks were inspired by the U.S./UK 2003 invasion of Iraq. Waters, who currently resides in the U.S., has said that the songs were written immediately after the start of the war, but he delayed releasing them until just before the 2004 Presidential election, hoping to derail George W. Bush’s re-election. The lyrics in <i>Leaving Beirut</i> included <i>"Oh George! Oh George! That Texas education must have fucked you up when you were very small."</i> Although the songs’ criticism was primarily aimed at the American government, Tony Blair is also referenced: <i>Not in my name, Tony, you great war leader, you.</i> The songs were also released as a limited edition on CD in Japan.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed <i>Wish You Were Here</i> with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On July 2, 2005 Waters and Pink Floyd reunited for a performance at the <i>Live 8</i> concert. They played a six-song, 23-minute set, including <i>Speak to Me/Breathe</i>/<i>Breathe (Reprise)</i>, <i>Money</i>, <i>Wish You Were Here</i>, and <i>Comfortably Numb</i>. Before going into <i>Wish You Were Here</i>, Waters said: <i>"It’s actually quite emotional standing up here with these three guys after all these years. Standing to be counted with the rest of you. Anyway, we’re doing this for everyone who’s not here, but particularly, of course, for Syd."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters remarked shortly after Live 8 to the Associated Press that, while the experience of playing as Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be “slight”, considering his and Gilmour’s continuing musical and ideological differences. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Waters further denied the possibility of a future Pink Floyd tour, saying <i>“I didn’t mind rolling over for one day, but I couldn’t roll over for a whole fucking tour.”</i> He has since stated on a radio interview that he would be interested in the possibility of recording a new album with the rest of Pink Floyd as long as he had creative control. However, David Gilmour has said on several occasions that he is retired from extensive touring, shedding more doubt on the possibility of a bona fide Pink Floyd reunion tour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters is known to be working on two new solo albums (as remarked to Jim Ladd, with whom he worked on <strong>Radio K.A.O.S.</strong>): one has the working title of Heartland. Two new songs that might appear on this album have been released on <strong>Flickering Flame: The Solo Years Vol. 1</strong>: <i>Each Small Candle</i> and <i>Flickering Flame</i>. The other of the two albums deals with the theme of love, much in the vein of Pros and Cons. A work-in-progress, which may appear on this album and was dubbed “Woman” by bootleggers, was heard during the sound checks for the In the Flesh tour. However, in a recent telephone interview, he confirmed that the release of his next project has been delayed due to not having a concept to draw all the individual songs together into one piece.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In February of 2005 , it was announced on Roger Waters’ website that his opera, <strong>Ća Ira</strong>, had been completed after 16 years of work. It was released as a CD/DVD set by Sony Classical on September 27, 2005 with Baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves. The original libretto was written in French by the late Catienne Roda-Gil, who set the opera during the optimistic days of the early French Revolution. From 1997 Waters rewrote the libretto in English.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On May 20, 2006 he performed with a set band consisting of Roger Taylor and Eric Clapton and former band-mate Nick Mason performing two songs, <i>Wish You Were Here</i>, and <i>Comfortably Numb</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Solid state laser system designed by Marc Brickman that depicted Dark Side of the Moon album art, used on Waters’ latest tour.Roger Waters toured Europe during the Summer of 2006 and North America in the fall for his <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon Live</strong> Tour. As part of his performance he played a complete run-through of the 1973 Pink Floyd classic, <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>, as the second half of the show. The first half was a mix of Floyd classics and Waters’ solo material. Elaborate staging designed by Marc Brickman, complete with projections, and a full, 360 degree quadrophonic sound system were used. This new Waters’ solo tour is expected to be as successful as his previous In the Flesh tour. His former Pink Floyd bandmate, Nick Mason joined Waters on some of the tour dates. Richard Wright was invited to participate on the tour as well but he declined the offer to work on solo projects. There is also a 2007 leg of the Tour, starting in January in Australia, followed by New Zealand and going through Asia, Europe, South America, and finally North America in June.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters’ former bandmate Nick Mason began patching their relationship in 2002. After speaking to Mason and Bob Geldof about a possible Pink Floyd reunion at <i>Live 8</i>, Waters contacted Gilmour by phone and e-mail, and it appears that they have buried the hatchet since the historic concert and now communicate on a friendly basis. Waters has made overtures to Richard Wright, as well. Syd Barrett, who died on Friday 7 July 2006, remained an emotional subject for most of his friends and former colleagues. Waters said in interviews before Barrett’s death that it would be difficult and inappropriate for him to try to insert himself back into his old friend’s life. Waters performed another <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> concert in the summer of 2007.</p>
		<br>
		<p>He contributed to the <i>The Last Mimzy</i> soundtrack with award-winning composer Howard Shore in March 2007. His song, <i>Hello (I Love You)</i>, was played during the credits of the film. Waters commented on its development: <i>“I think together we’ve come up with a song that captures the themes of the movie – the clash between humanity’s best and worst instincts, and how a child’s innocence can win the day.”</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>In March 2007, Roger Waters told Rolling Stone magazine that he would be a performer at the U.S. leg of the <i>Live Earth</i> event–an international multi-venue concert aimed to raise awareness about global climate change. At that time he also confirmed that his former Pink Floyd bandmates would not be joining him at the event. On July 7th, 2007, Waters played at Live Earth, performing the intro to <i>In the Flesh</i>, <i>Money</i>, <i>Us and Them</i>, <i>Brain Damage</i>, and <i>Eclipse</i>. Waters finished off with <i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i> and <i>Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)</i>, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademark inflatable pig.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters has also recently become a spokesperson for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and malaria. He wrote a special commentary for CNN’s website on June 11, 2007 about the topic.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Roger Waters will continue his <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon Live</strong> tour in 2008. It is still unknown how many dates are planned, but as of December 21, 2007, a concert in The Netherlands May 11, and a concert in Denmark May 13, have been announced and are currently on sale. Waters will also be performing at the Coachella Festival in April. He will also be doing three dates in the UK, one being 15th May at the new Liverpool Echo arena, the remaining to at the O2 arena in London on the 18th and 19th, plus an additional date in Russia to round up his 2008 DSOTM tour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Waters has made his views about the 2008 United States Presidential election clear. During his concert appearance at the Coachella Festival on April 27th, 2008, he released the trademark Pink Floyd inflatable pig into the air with the words <i>“Don’t be led to the slaughter”</i>written on one side, next to a cartoon of Uncle Sam holding meat cleavers. <i>Fear builds walls</i> was written on the pig’s other side and <i>Impeach Bush</i> on the pig’s behind. On the pig’s belly was Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama’s name with a check mark beside it. Waters has referred to Hillary Clinton, another Democratic candidate, as <i>“ghastly”</i>.</p>

		<h3>David Gilmour Biography</h3>
		<h5>Member 1967-2014</h5>
		<div class="imageHolderBio"> <img src="images/bandmembers/bame-david-gilmour.jpg" alt="David Gilmour Portrait" /> <div class="caption"><br>David Gilmour</div> </div><p><strong>David Gilmour</strong> was born in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia, was a teacher and film editor.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, and met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. He studied modern languages to A-Level, and along with Syd, spent his lunchtime learning to play the guitar. They were not yet bandmates however, and Gilmour started playing in the band <i>Joker’s Wild</i> in 1963. Gilmour left <i>Joker’s Wild</i> in 1966 and busked around Spain and France with some friends. However, they were not very successful, living virtually a hand-to-mouth existence. In July 1992, Gilmour stated in an interview with Nicky Horne on BBC radio that he ended up being treated for malnutrition in a hospital. In 1967, they returned to England, driving a van with fuel stolen from a building site in France.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour was approached in December 1967 by drummer Nick Mason, who asked Gilmour if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd, which he did in January 1968, making Pink Floyd briefly a five-piece band. He was used to fill in for Barrett’s guitar parts when the front man was unable to take a consistent part in Floyd’s live performances. When Syd Barrett <i>“left”</i> the group (the band chose not to pick him up one night for a gig due to his erratic behaviour), Gilmour by default assumed the role of the band’s lead guitarist and shared lead vocal duties with Roger Waters and Richard Wright in Barrett’s stead. However, after the back-to-back successes of <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> and then <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong>, Waters took more control over the band, writing most of <strong>Animals</strong> and <strong>The Wall</strong> by himself. Wright was fired during <strong>The Wall</strong> sessions and the relationship between Gilmour and Waters would further deteriorate during the making of <strong>The Wall</strong> film and the 1983 Pink Floyd album <strong>The Final Cut</strong>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After recording <strong>Animals</strong>, Gilmour thought that his musical influence had been underutilized, and channeled his ideas into his self-titled first solo album (1978), which showcases his signature guitar style, as well as underscoring his songwriting skills. A tune written during the finishing stages of this album, but too late to be used, became <i>Comfortably Numb</i> on <strong>The Wall</strong>. The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of <strong>The Wall</strong> album and film, compounded by <strong>The Final Cut</strong>’s virtually being a Roger Waters solo album,” led Gilmour to produce a second solo album, <strong>About Face</strong> <i>(1984)</i> to lukewarm praise. The <i>About Face</i> tour suffered from weak ticket sales; a similar dilemma confronted by Waters, whose <strong>The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking</strong> <i>(1984)</i> lifted in critical opinion only by the presence of Eric Clapton on the record and the subsequent tour, though it was frequently noted that Clapton’s sound was distinctly Gilmour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd was <i>“A spent force creatively“</i>. However, in 1986, Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason issued a press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue on without Waters. Gilmour assumed full control of the group and produced <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong> in 1987 with some contributions from Mason and Rick Wright. Wright officially rejoined the band for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994′s <strong>The Division Bell</strong> as well. Gilmour explained: <i>"I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> and <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong> were so successful not just because of Roger’s contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. That’s what I’m trying to do with <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong>; more focus on the music, restore the balance."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat <i>Astoria</i> which is moored on the River Thames near Hampton Court, and transformed it into a recording studio. The majority of the two most recent Pink Floyd albums, as well as Gilmour’s 2006 solo release <strong>On An Island</strong> were recorded there.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On July 2, 2005, Gilmour played with Pink Floyd, including Roger Waters, at <i>Live 8</i>. The performance caused a temporary 1343% sales increase of Pink Floyd’s album <strong>Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd</strong>. As a result, Gilmour vowed to donate all of his resulting profits to charities that reflect the goals of <i>Live 8</i> saying: <i>"Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Shortly after, he called upon all artists experiencing a surge in sales from Live 8 performances to donate the extra revenue to Live 8 fund-raising. After the Live 8 concert, Pink Floyd were offered GBP150 million to tour the states, but the band turned down the lucrative offer.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On February 3, 2006, he announced in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that Pink Floyd would most likely never tour or write material together again. He said: <i>"I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don’t have the will to work as much anymore. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it’s over. For me it’s much less complicated to work alone."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>He said that by agreeing to <i>Live 8</i>, he had ensured the story of Floyd would not end on a sour note. <i>"There was more than one reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy consuming an uncomfortable relationship between Roger and me that I was carrying along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>On February 20, 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd’s future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, <i>“Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out.”</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Syd Barrett, who had died in July that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyd’s first single <i>Arnold Layne</i>. Recorded live at London’s Royal Albert Hall, the CD single featured versions of the song performed by Pink Floyd’s keyboard player (and Gilmour’s band member) Richard Wright and special guest artist David Bowie. The single entered the UK Top 75 charts at number nineteen and remained steady for three weeks.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. However, in a 2007 interview with Phil Manzanera, he stated that he’s “not done with yet” and that he plans on doing <i>“something”</i> in the future.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Taking time off from Pink Floyd’s schedule, Gilmour also took up various roles as a producer, sideman and even concert sound engineer for a wide variety of acts which included former bandmate Syd Barrett, Kate Bush, Grace Jones, Tom Jones, Elton John, B.B. King, Paul McCartney, Sam Brown, Jools Holland, Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend, The Who, Supertramp, Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Alan Parsons, and various charity groups among others.In 1985, Gilmour performed with Bryan Ferry at the Wembley Live Aid concert.</p>
		<br>
		<p>He has also recorded three solo albums, of which David Gilmour (1978) and About Face (1984), charted at the U.S. Top 40 and went Gold.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 2001 and 2002, he held a small number of acoustic solo concerts in London and Paris, along with a small band and choir, which was documented on the In Concert release. In 2003, Rolling Stone included Gilmour in the list of hundred greatest guitarists of all time.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On his 60th birthday, he released his third solo album, <strong>On An Island</strong>, on March 6, 2006 and a day later it was released in the US; it debuted at #1 in the UK charts. The album reached Top five in Germany and Sweden, and Top six in Billboard 200. Produced by Gilmour along with Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas, the album features orchestrations by renowned Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner. The album features David Crosby and Graham Nash on harmonies on the title track, Robert Wyatt on cornet and percussion and Richard Wright on Hammond organ and vocals. Other contributors include Jools Holland, Phil Manzanera, Georgie Fame, Andy Newmark, B. J. Cole, Chris Stainton, Willie Wilson and Rado Boba Klose on guitar. The album also features Gilmour’s debut with the saxophone.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour toured Europe, US and Canada from March 10 to May 31 to promote <strong>On An Island</strong>. There were 10 shows in the US and Canadian leg of the tour. Pink Floyd alumnus Richard Wright, and frequent Floyd collaborators Dick Parry, Guy Pratt and Jon Carin also accompanied him on the tour. More shows were held in Europe during from July through August in 2006.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In a press release to promote the tour, David Gilmour stated: <i>“I’m rather hoping that with this tour announcement, people will believe me when I say, honestly, this is the only band I plan to tour with!”.</i> <strong>On An Island</strong> peaked the UK charts by reaching number one. On April 10, 2006, the album was certified platinum in Canada, with sales of over 100,000 copies. The album also gave Gilmour his first US Top 10 album as a solo artist.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A video recording of a show from Gilmour’s solo tour, entitled <i>Remember That Night – Live At The Royal Albert Hall</i> was released on September 17, 2007. The double DVD, directed by David Mallet, contains over five hours of footage, including an on-the-road documentary and guest appearances by David Bowie and Robert Wyatt. The two and a half hour concert features band members Richard Wright of Pink Floyd, Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music, Steve DiStanislao on drums, and various Pink Floyd regulars such as Dick Parry, Guy Pratt and Jon Carin. The 20-page booklet accompanying the DVD, features over 80 photos selected from studio recording and touring. The album is now available on Hi-Definition Blu-ray Disc with TrueHD surround sound. As TrueHD is not a mandatory format for Blu-ray players, and the disc carries no other surround channel, some players will only play it in stereo.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The final show of David Gilmour’s <strong>On an Island Tour</strong> was held at the Gdansk Shipyard on August 26, 2006. The concert was held before a huge crowd of 100,000, and marked the twenty-sixth anniversary of Poland’s 1980 revolution. The concert was notable for the inclusion of <i>“A Great Day For Freedom”</i> as part of the encore.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Although mainly known for his guitar work, Gilmour is also a proficient multi-instrumentalist. He also plays bass guitar (which he did on some Pink Floyd tracks), keyboards, harmonica, drums (as heard on the Syd Barrett solo track <i>Dominoes</i>, and other songs where he opted to play all the instruments) and lately, the saxophone.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In his early career with Pink Floyd Gilmour played a multitude of Fender Stratocasters. One of his popular guitar solos (<i>Another Brick in the Wall Part 2</i>) was played on a Gibson Les Paul guitar. In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. In August 2006, Gilmour’s solo on <i>Comfortably Numb</i> was voted the greatest guitar solo of all time in a poll by listeners of the digital radio station Planet Rock.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour’s first marriage was to American-born Virginia “Ginger” Hasenbein and he had four children from this union, Alice (born 1976), Clare (born 1979), Sara (born 1983), and Matthew (born 1986). The children originally attended a Waldorf School, but Gilmour called their education there <i>“horrific”</i>. He has four children from his second marriage to Polly Samson – Charlie (Samson’s son with Heathcote Williams) whom Gilmour adopted and Joe, Gabriel and Romany. Charlie’s voice can be heard on the telephone to Steve O’Rourke, at the end of <i>High Hopes</i> (<strong>The Division Bell</strong>).</p>
		<br>
		<p>Gilmour has been associated with various charity organisations. In May 2003, Gilmour sold his house in Little Venice to the ninth Earl Spencer and donated the proceeds worth £3.6 million to Crisis to help fund a housing project for the homeless. Apart from Crisis, other Charities to which Gilmour has lent support include Oxfam, the European Union Mental Health and Illness Association, Greenpeace, Amnesty International, The Lung Foundation, and Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Apart from music, Gilmour is also an experienced pilot. Under the aegis of his company, Intrepid Aviation, he had amassed an impressive collection of historical aircraft. He later decided to sell the company, as his venture, which had started as a hobby was becoming too commercial for him to handle. In an interview to BBC, he stated: <i>"Intrepid Aviation was a way for me to make my hobby pay for itself a little bit, but gradually over a few years Intrepid Aviation became a business because you have to be businesslike about it. Suddenly I found instead of it being a hobby and me enjoying myself, it was a business and so I sold it. I don’t have Intrepid Aviation any more. I just have a nice old biplane that I pop up, wander around the skies in sometimes."</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>On 22 May 2008, Gilmour won the 2008 Ivor Novello Lifetime Contribution Award.</p>

		<h3>Richard Wright Biography</h3>
		<h5>Member 1965-2008</h5>
		<div class="imageHolderBio"> <img src="images/bandmembers/bame-richard-wright.jpg" alt="Richard Wright Portrait" /> <div class="caption"><br>Richard Wright</div> </div><p><strong>Richard Wright</strong> (born July 28, 1943 in Hatch End, London) is a self-taught pianist and keyboardist best known for his long career with Pink Floyd. Though not as prolific a songwriter as his bandmates Syd Barrett, Roger Waters and David Gilmour, he did write significant parts of the music for classic albums like <strong>Meddle</strong>, <strong>Dark Side of the Moon</strong> and <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong>, as well as for Pink Floyd’s most recent studio album <strong>The Division Bell</strong>. Wright’s richly textured keyboard layers have been a vital ingredient and a distinctive characteristic of Pink Floyd’s sound. In addition, Wright frequently sang background and occasionally lead vocals onstage and in the studio with Pink Floyd (most notably on the songs <i>Time</i>, <i>Echoes</i>, and on the Syd Barrett composition <i>Astronomy Domine</i>).</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright was educated at the Haberdashers’ Aske’s School and the Regent Street Polytechnic College of Architecture, where he met fellow band members Roger Waters and Nick Mason. He was a founding member of <i>The Pink Floyd Sound</i> (as they were then called) in 1965, and also participated in its previous incarnations, <i>Sigma 6</i> and <i>The (Screaming) Abdabs</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In the early days of Pink Floyd, Wright was seen as a dominant musical force in the group (though not as much of one as Syd Barrett, the band’s chief songwriter and front man at the time) and he wrote and sang several songs of his own during 1967-68. While not credited as a singer on <strong>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</strong>, he sung lead on Barrett-penned songs like <i>Astronomy Domine</i> and <i>Matilda Mother</i>, as well as notable harmonies on <i>Scarecrow</i> and <i>Chapter 24</i>. Examples of his early compositions include <i>Remember a Day</i>, <i>Paintbox</i> and <i>It Would Be So Nice</i>. As the sound and the goals of the band evolved, Wright became less interested in songwriting and focused primarily on contributing his distinctive style to extended instrumental compositions such as <i>Interstellar Overdrive</i>, <i>A Saucerful of Secrets</i>, <i>Careful with That Axe, Eugene</i>, <i>One Of These Days</i> and to musical themes for film scores (<strong>More</strong>, <strong>Zabriskie Point</strong> and <strong>Obscured by Clouds</strong>). He also made essential contributions to Pink Floyd’s long, epic compositions such as <i>Atom Heart Mother</i>, <i>Echoes</i> and <i>Shine On You Crazy Diamond</i>. His most commercially popular compositions are <i>The Great Gig in the Sky</i> and <i>Us and Them</i> from 1973′s <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>. He also contributed significantly to other mid-period Floyd classics like <i>Breathe</i> and <i>Time</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright recorded his first solo project, <strong>Wet Dream</strong>, and released it in September 1978 with little fanfare. However, the album is regarded with some acclaim among Pink Floyd fans. Battling both personal problems and an increasingly rocky relationship with Roger Waters, he was forced to resign from Pink Floyd during <strong>The Wall</strong> sessions by Roger Waters, who threatened to pull the plug on the album’s tapes if Wright did not leave the band. However, he was retained as a salaried session musician during the subsequent live concerts to promote that album in 1980 and 1981. Ironically, Wright became the only member of Pink Floyd to profit from those hugely spectacular shows, since the net financial loss had to be borne by the three remaining “full-time” members. He was the only member of the band not to attend the 1982 premiere of the film version of <strong>The Wall</strong>. In 1983, Pink Floyd released the only album on which Wright does not appear with <strong>The Final Cut</strong>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>During 1984, Wright formed a new musical duo with Dave Harris (from the band Fashion) called <i>Zee</i>. They signed a record deal with Atlantic Records and released only one album, <strong>Identity</strong>, which was a commercial and critical flop. Wright rejoined Pink Floyd following Waters’ departure. Because of legal and contractual issues from his “hired gun” status during <strong>The Wall</strong> world tour, Wright’s photo was not included in the 1987 album <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong> and his name was listed in smaller letters than Mason and Gilmour. By the time of the world tour and the 1988 live album <strong>The Delicate Sound of Thunder</strong>, Wright was contractually a member of Pink Floyd once again. In 1994, he co-wrote five songs and sang lead vocals on one song (<i>Wearing the Inside Out</i>) for the next Pink Floyd album, <strong>The Division Bell</strong>. This recording provided material for the double live album and video release <strong>P•U•L•S•E</strong> in 1995. Wright, like Nick Mason, has performed on every Pink Floyd tour.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In 1996, inspired by his successful input into <strong>The Division Bell</strong>, Wright released his second solo album, <strong>Broken China</strong>, including contributions from Sinead O’Connor on vocals, Pino Palladino on bass, Manu Katcho on drums, Dominic Miller (known from his guitar work with Sting) and Tim Renwick, another Pink Floyd associate, on electric guitar. <strong>Broken China</strong> was considered to be a more focused and artistically successful work than <strong>Wet Dream</strong> and marked a new phase in Rick Wright’s modus operandi, with extensive use of computer-based recording and production techniques, assisted by Anthony Moore with whom he co-wrote the album’s lyrics.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On July 2, 2005, Wright, Gilmour, Mason were joined by Waters on stage for the first time since <strong>The Wall</strong> concerts for a short set at the Live 8 concert in London. Wright underwent eye surgery for cataracts in November 2005, preventing him from attending Pink Floyd’s induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame. Roger Waters, who was also unable to attend the band’s induction due to rehearsals for the opening of his opera <strong>Ća Ira</strong> in Rome, appeared in video link and stated, tongue-in-cheek: <i>"Rick actually hasn’t had an eye operation, he and I have eloped to Rome and we’re living happily in a small apartment off the Via Venuti!"</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright contributed keyboards and background vocals to David Gilmour’s most recent solo album, <strong>On An Island</strong>, and performed with Gilmour’s touring band for over two dozen shows in Europe and North America in 2006. On stage with Gilmour he performed piano, electric piano and synth leads with his Kurzweil K2600 workstation, Hammond organ and even his long-inactive Farfisa organ, which was resurrected especially for performing <i>Echoes</i> and a couple of Pink Floyd’s and Syd Barrett’s older numbers that Gilmour chose to revisit in his recent concerts. He also provided backing vocals and lead vocals (notably on <i>Echoes</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Comfortably Numb</i>, <i>Wearing the Inside Out</i> <i>Astronomy Domine</i> and <i>Arnold Layne</i> - the latter released as a live single). He declined an offer to join Roger Waters and Nick Mason on Waters’ <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon Live</strong> tour in order to spend more time working on an upcoming solo project (which may be an instrumental album released in 2008).</p>
		<br>
		<p>On July 4, 2006, Wright joined Gilmour and Mason for the official screening of the <strong>P•U•L•S•E</strong> DVD. Inevitably, <i>Live 8</i> surfaced as a subject in an interview. When asked about performing again, Wright replied he would be happy on stage anywhere. He explained that his plan is to “meander” along and said about playing live: <i>"...and whenever Dave wants me to play with him, I’m really happy to play with him. And [to Gilmour] you’ll play with me, right?"</i> However, Wright has stated that he has no desire to perform as part of an officially-reformed ‘Pink Floyd’ again, stating that the Live 8 concert was nice as a <i>“one off.”</i> Nevertheless, in a recent documentary on the band aired by the BBC, Wright mentioned that he would love to tour the band’s music again.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright has the lowest profile of any member of a band known for their lack of individual attention seeking. Unlike the three other surviving band members who have emerged as public figures, Wright rarely speaks in public. Oddly enough, Wright was very rarely seen in the live footage from the <i>Live 8</i> reunion performance, with a few exceptions he was only shown in wide shots. Some have suggested that the director of the broadcast did not know which musician was the fourth member of Pink Floyd until the very end when they got together for a group shot.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright has been married to his third wife Millie (to whom he dedicated his second solo album <strong>Broken China</strong>) since 1996 and they have one child named Ben. He married his first wife Juliette Gale in 1964 and they divorced in 1982 after two children. He married his second wife Franka in 1984 and they divorced in 1994.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright has a daughter Gala, who in 1996 married Guy Pratt, a session musician who has played bass for Pink Floyd since Roger Waters’ exit.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wright died at home of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65.At the time of his death, he had been working on a new solo album, which was thought to comprise a series of instrumental pieces.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The surviving members of Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute. Waters said <i>"it is hard to overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s"</i> and was happy that they had managed to reunite for <i>Live 8</i>. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were underrated, and that his playing <i>"was the sound that knitted it all together"</i>, comparing his <i>"quiet one"</i> status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him <i>"my musical partner and my friend"</i>, praised the ability of the two men's voices to blend, such as on <i>Echoes</i>. Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that it would be wrong to resume touring without him.</p>

		<h3>Nick Mason Biography</h3>
		<h5>Member 1964-2014</h5>
		<div class="imageHolderBio"> <img src="images/bandmembers/bame-nick-mason.jpg" alt="Nick Mason Portrait" /> <div class="caption"><br>Nick Mason</div> </div><p><strong>Nick Mason</strong> (born January 27, 1944 in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England) is the drummer for Pink Floyd. He has been the only constant member of the band since its formation. He also competes in auto racing events, such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The son of the documentary film maker Bill Mason, he was born in Birmingham but brought up in Hampstead, London (many online biographies mistakenly cite the street address Downshire Hill – sometimes as “the Downshire Hills” – as a district of Birmingham) and attended Frensham Heights School, Surrey. He later studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster), where he teamed up with Roger Waters, Bob Klose and Richard Wright in 1964 to form Pink Floyd’s predecessor, <i>Sigma 6</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Mason has played drums on every Pink Floyd album, although it was later revealed that his contributions to the album <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong> were quite minimal.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Despite conflicts over ownership of the name ‘Pink Floyd’, Roger Waters and Nick Mason are now on good terms. Mason joined Waters on the last two nights of his 2002 world tour to play drums on the Pink Floyd song “Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun”, and he also played drums on some concerts of Waters’ European tour in 2006, and during performances in Los Angeles and New York City in the United States. On May 12, 2007, Mason joined Waters again on stage at Earls Court to play <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In July 2005, Mason, Gilmour, Wright, and Waters played together on stage for the first time in 24 years. A four song set was played at the <i>Live 8</i> concert in London. Mason also joined David Gilmour and Richard Wright for the encore during Gilmour’s show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on May 31, 2006, reuniting the post-Waters Pink Floyd. Mason has also claimed to be the link between Gilmour and Waters, and believes the band will play live again. His answers have ranged from <i>“playing again for a charitable cause”</i> to <i>“a tour”</i> given in various interviews in the last few years. He also stated in 2006 that Pink Floyd have not officially disbanded yet.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The only Pink Floyd songs that are solely credited to Mason are <i>The Grand Vizier’s Garden Party Parts 1-3</i> (from <strong>Ummagumma</strong>) and <i>Speak to Me</i> (from <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>). The one-off song by the band entitled <i>Nick’s Boogie</i> was named after him.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The only times Mason’s voice has been included on Pink Floyd’s albums are <i>Corporal Clegg</i>, the single spoken line in <i>One of These Days</i> and spoken parts of <i>Signs of Life</i> and <i>Learning to Fly</i> (the latter taken from actual recording of Mason’s first solo flight) from <strong>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</strong>. He does, however, sing lead vocals on two unreleased but heavily bootlegged tracks, <i>Scream Thy Last Scream</i> (1967) and <i>The Merry Xmas Song</i> (1975-1976). In live performances of the song <i>Sheep</i>, he did the spoken section.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Unlike the other members of Pink Floyd, Mason has rarely played an instrument other than his usual one (drums). He has only ever played non-percussive instruments on <i>The Grand Vizier’s Garden Party</i>, his personal composition from <strong>Ummagumma</strong>, where he provided some keyboard, guitar and bass noises, and on live versions of <i>Outside the Wall</i>, where he played acoustic guitar along with the rest of the band. He has claimed that he took some failed violin and piano lessons as a child.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Mason has done some work with other people, notably as a drummer and producer for Steve Hillage, Robert Wyatt, The Damned and Gong. He also drummed for Michael Mantler.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Mason is married (to his second wife, Nettie) and has four children; two daughters (Holly and Chloe) from his first marriage and two sons (Guy and Cary) from his second. They live in Hampstead, London however they often stay in the Wiltshire town of Corsham in the former home of Camilla Parker Bowles.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As Floyd’s recording and touring schedule grew more sporadic, Mason was left with more time to pursue his favourite hobby, auto racing. He owns (through his company Ten Tenths) and races several classic cars, and has competed successfully at the 24 hours of Le Mans. His collection has been a subject of his 1998 book, <i>Into the Red</i> which he documents his experience with his cars along with some histories. He is also a qualified pilot, and flies a Aerospatiale AS 350 Squirrel helicopter in specially painted colours.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Mason was invited by Ferrari to purchase one of their 400 Enzos, which Jeremy Clarkson pleaded with him to borrow for reviewing purposes on the BBC motoring programme <i>Top Gear</i>. Mason agreed, on the sole condition that throughout the review, Clarkson promoted the release of <i>Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd</i>. This led to Clarkson using Pink Floyd album titles in his description of the Enzo and The Stig driving round the track with <i>Another Brick In The Wall</i> playing. Mason says that his favourite car of all time is the Ferrari 250 GTO, and owns one of the 36 built. He later sold his Ferrari Enzo to millionaire Mohammad Jamil for £650,000.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Nick Mason’s book, <i>Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd</i>, was published in the UK in October 2004. It is also available, abridged, as a 3CD audio book, read by Mason.</p>
		<br>
		<p>He is worth £55 million according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2006-2007.</p>
